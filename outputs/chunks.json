    "content": "# Trending Charts on YouTube\n\nYouTube Charts provide a dynamic daily spotlight on the most popular content from across the globe.\n\n## What determines if a video is ranked on Charts?\n\nAmongst the many great new videos on YouTube on any given day, trending Charts can only show a limited number. Trending Charts aim to surface videos that:\n\n  * Are relevant to the topic of the chart \n  * Are growing quickly\n  * Are not misleading, clickbaity or sensational\n  * Showcase a diversity of creators\n\nCharts aim to balance all of these considerations. To achieve this, Trending considers many signals, including (but not limited to):\n\n  * View count\n  * How quickly the video’s view count (or ‘temperature’) is growing\n  * Where views are coming from, including outside of YouTube\n  * The topic of the videos\n  * The age of the video\n  * How the video performs compared to other recent uploads from the same channel\n\nAs these signals are combined to produce charts automatically, the video with the highest view count on a given day may not be #1 on a given trending chart, and videos with more views may be shown below videos with fewer views.\n\n**Note:** Views from YouTube ads are not included in a video’s view count when measuring videos for trending charts.\n\nWe're very careful about the safety of what appears on trending charts, so we have filters to make sure that we don't show videos that contain excessive profanity, mature content or violence, or videos that are otherwise inappropriate, such as disparaging others in the community.  \n  \nYouTube doesn't accept payment for placement on trending charts and doesn't favor specific creators.\n\n[SOURCE]: https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/7239739?hl=en&ref_topic=9257501\n[CATEGORY]: Find videos to watch__Find videos on YouTube\n\n"

These channels are titled “Artist Name - Topic” and say “auto-generated by YouTube” in the channel’s About section. Learn about auto-generated topic channels for artists below.\n  * An Official Artist Channel , a collection of an artist’s music and videos from across all their different YouTube channels. You can find an artist's Official Artist Channel (OAC) by searching for the artist on YouTube. You can also find their OAC by watching an artist's official music video. Learn about Official Artist Channels.\n\nIf you’re already subscribed to an artist’s topic channel or partner-provided channel, you’ll automatically be subscribed to their Official Artist Channel when it’s created. Notifications will then be sent from the artist's Official Artist Channel. Learn about notifications from artists below.\n\nOnce subscribed to an artist’s Official Artist Channel, your subscriptions to their topic channel and partner-provided channel will be inactive. This means they’ll no longer be in your subscriptions list. You can still find an artist's topic channel or partner-provided channel in Search, but these channels will no longer have a subscribe button.\n\nAs always, you can manage your subscriptions for any channel you subscribe to, including Official Artist Channels.\n\n[SOURCE]: https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/7636475?hl=en&ref_topic=9257501\n[CATEGORY]: Find videos to watch__Find videos on YouTube\n\n"

These predictions come from possible search terms related to what you’re looking for and what other people have already searched for.\n\n## Where search predictions come from\n\n  * Search terms you enter.\n  * If you’re signed in to your Google Account, and depending on your settings, relevant searches you’ve done or videos you’ve watched in the past.\n  * What other people are searching for, including trending searches. Trending searches are popular topics in your area that change during the day and aren’t related to your search history.\n\n**Note:** Search predictions aren’t the answer to your search. They also aren’t statements by other people or YouTube about your search terms.\n\n[SOURCE]: https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/9872296?hl=en&ref_topic=9257501\n[CATEGORY]: Find videos to watch__Find videos on YouTube\n\n"
